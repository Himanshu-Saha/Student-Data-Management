### Abstract 
---
As we know that in a big institution, like ours, it is very difficult to manage the data of each student and add and delete data of new and old students respectively each year.
This project is intended to provide an efficient student data management system and add or delete any important information about any student.

### Introduction
---

Colleges are the cradle of knowledge and the fountain that feeds students. It's mandatory to have the best in place for it to function the way it should and pass across relevant information to students. For it to function accordingly, a proper management system is one of the basic but significant things that should be in place. Therefore, an easy-to-use student management system would solve a great number of problems for the institution

### SYSTEM ANALYSIS
---
> EXISTING SYSTEM:
Currently the teachers record the important information or the results of the student on a handwritten sheet or a shared excel file. It is not a bad way but while sharing the result or information of any one student it is seen by all other students in the class. Some students are not comfortable with sharing their marks or information (such as mobile number) with other students. Also there is a chance of misplacing the record sheet or misuse of information by any other student.

>   PROPOSED SYSTEM:
To counter the above problems we need a software that each       student can access his/her information as well as marks individually  so they are not seen by others. In this software, there could be a special id-password for each student to login and see the data and a special password for admin to enter or correct the data.

### AIM OF PROJECT

This project provides a common platform between the students and teachers but in a more privacy friendly way. It makes the time consuming and hectic process of student enrollment easy by reducing the paperwork considerably and digitizing each process for achieving productivity and transparency. The information of every student can be systematically arranged and efficiently updated whenever needed, and ready to use. The admin can also effortlessly update the marksheet of students in the software. There is a very little chance of data being misused. Hence, it overall satisfies both the faculty and the students of the college.

### COMPILER SPECIFICATIONS

The software has been designed in g++ compiler  with the help of std c++ 11 language but it should be able to work on any other compiler as well.

### DESIGN

For proper functioning of code and providing a systematic approach to it the software had to be divided into four different files each file contains a specific set of codes

### ADVANTAGES

- Eco-Friendly: paperwork can be avoided
- Efficient control over student data
- Monitor student performance
- Supervise multiple branches
- Cost-efficient and User-friendly
- Single solution for total College management
